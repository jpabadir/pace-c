# Heuristic evaluation experiment instructions #
- Heuristic evaluation is a thorough assessment of a product's user interface, and its purpose is to detect usability issues that may occur when users interact with a product, and identify ways to resolve them.

## 10 User Interface Design Heuristics ##
1. **Visibility of system status.** system status should be displayed when operations are executed like a toast message. For example, When a button is onclicked, a toast message or any other forms of message should tell user what button they are clicking on.
2. **Match between system and the real world.** System should be designed using such as icons, languages, syntax from real world. For example, Icons like calendars should be a real mini-calendar image to indicate that by clicking this icon a calandar will be displayed.
3. **User control and freedom.** System are avaliable to be undoable or redoable. For example, 'back' buttons and 'undo' buttons.
4. **Consistency and standards.** UI designers should make sure that staffs such as frames, icons, and font under the similar or even the same categories should be consistent.
5. **Error prevention.** Technical problems should not occur during User operations. Eliminating or flagging actions that may result in errors are two possible means of achieving error prevention.
6. **Recognition rather than recall.** Minimize cognitive load by maintaining task-relevant information within the display while users explore the interface. Human attention is limited and we are only capable of maintaining around five items in our short-term memory at one time. Due to the limitations of short-term memory, designers should ensure users can simply employ recognition instead of recalling information across parts of the dialogue. Recognizing something is always easier than recall because recognition involves perceiving cues that help us reach into our vast memory and allowing relevant information to surface. For example, we often find the format of multiple choice questions easier than short answer questions on a test because it only requires us to recognize the answer rather than recall it from our memory.
7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use.** With increased use comes the demand for less interactions that allow faster navigation. This can be achieved by using abbreviations, function keys, hidden commands and macro facilities. Users should be able to customize or tailor the interface to suit their needs so that frequent actions can be achieved through more convenient means.
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design.** Keep clutter to a minimum. All unnecessary information competes for the user's limited attentional resources, which could inhibit user’s memory retrieval of relevant information. Therefore, the display must be reduced to only the necessary components for the current tasks, whilst providing clearly visible and unambiguous means of navigating to other content.
9. **Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors.** Designers should assume users are unable to understand technical terminology, therefore, error messages should almost always be expressed in plain language to ensure nothing gets lost in translation.
10. **Help and documentation.** Ideally, we want users to navigate the system without having to resort to documentation. However, depending on the type of solution, documentation may be necessary. When users require help, ensure it is easily located, specific to the task at hand and worded in a way that will guide them through the necessary steps towards a solution to the issue they are facing.

## How to Conduct our Heuristic Evaluation ##
1. **Establish an appropriate list of heuristics** according to the list above.
2. **Select your evaluators.** Make sure to carefully choose your evaluators. Your evaluators should not be your end users. They should typically be usability experts and preferably with domain expertise in the industry type that your product is in. For example, an evaluator investigating a Point-of-Sale system for the restaurant industry should have at least a general understanding of restaurant operations.
3. **Select your evaluators.(3-5 evaluators)** Make sure to carefully choose your evaluators. Your evaluators should not be your end users. They should typically be usability experts and preferably with domain expertise in the industry type that your product is in. For example, an evaluator investigating a Point-of-Sale system for the restaurant industry should have at least a general understanding of restaurant operations.
4. **Brief your evaluators** so they know exactly what they are meant to do and cover during their evaluation. The briefing session should be standardized to ensure the evaluators receive the same instructions; otherwise you may bias their evaluation. Within this brief, you may wish to ask the evaluators to focus on a selection of tasks, but sometimes they may state which tasks they will cover on the basis of their experience and expertise.
5. **First evaluation phase.** The first evaluation generally takes around two hours, depending on the nature and complexity of your product. The evaluators will use the product freely to gain a feel for the methods of interaction and the scope. **They will then identify specific elements that they want to evaluate.**
6. **Second evaluation phase.** In the second evaluation phase, the evaluators will carry out another run-through, whilst applying the chosen heuristics to the elements identified during the first phase. **The evaluators would focus on individual elements** and look at how well they fit in the overall design.
7. **Record problems.** The evaluators must either record problems themselves or you should record them as they carry out their various tasks to track any problems they encounter. Be sure to ask the evaluators to be as detailed and specific as possible when recording problems.
8. **Debriefing session.** The debriefing session involves collaboration between the different evaluators to collate their findings and establish a complete list of problems. They should then be encouraged to suggest potential solutions for these problems on the basis of the heuristics.
